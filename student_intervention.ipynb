In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and it will be your job to implement the additional functionality necessary to successfully complete this project. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `'TODO'` statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  \n",

    "**Answer: ** This is a classification problem. We can state our problem as labelling students as 'needing intervention' or 'not needing intervention'. This set of discrete labels that need to be predicted makes this a classification problem. We could also try to predict the probability of success for the students (which could be regression), but main interest here is in identifying the students needing help, so labelling them is sufficient here. There is always a chance that there could be further distinction within students who need help, (For example there could be students who need urgent intervention and students who cannot be helped at all), but since that is not stated in the problem, model does not have to find such sub categories. Also from the dataset, the target variable is clearly is a categorical variable making this, much more clearly, a classification problem. "

    "As you can see, there are several non-numeric columns that need to be converted! Many of them are simply `yes`/`no`, e.g. `internet`. These can be reasonably converted into `1`/`0` (binary) values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other columns, like `Mjob` and `Fjob`, have more than two values, and are known as _categorical variables_. The recommended way to handle such a column is to create as many columns as possible values (e.g. `Fjob_teacher`, `Fjob_other`, `Fjob_services`, etc.), and assign a `1` to one of them and `0` to all others.\n",
    "\n",
    "These generated columns are sometimes called _dummy variables_, and we will use the [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) function to perform this transformation. Run the code cell below to perform the preprocessing routine discussed in this section."

So the Random Forest should work well with this data. Random Forests are used for classification and Regression applications. One application in our industry is in building a customer retention model using Random Forests. (http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1707571) Random Forest methods as implemented in R also tell us which variables are important in predicting the response variable. \n",

The training cost can be hidden from the consumers as the model can be trained offline.

    "**Answer: ** Random Forest is a ensemble method which makes predictions based on several simple classifiers to make a prediction about an example. Each simple classifier in this case makes simple decisions to decide whether a student has passed or not. For example a simple decision rule would be that student will graduate if his/her study time is greater than some value S and if her attendance is greater than some value A. There are 30 such factors based on which decision rules can be formed. (Such factors are called features). Random Forest builds several such simple classifiers (called decision trees) using random set of features. To predict whether a student would graduate, the Random Forest uses these simple classifiers to make a predict and then takes a majority vote to make its prediction. For example if Random Forest used 100 simple classifiers, and for a student 75 of the classifiers predict passed = 'yes' and 25 predict passed = 'no', then Random Forest will predict that student will pass.
